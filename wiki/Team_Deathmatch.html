<span><strong>Team Deathmatch</strong> is a major event in the Hypixel Pit. Like all major events, when it occurs, 3 minutes advance warning is given. Team Deathmatch (often abbreviated to TDM) lasts for 4 minutes.</span><br>
<span>When Team Deathmatch starts, all players are assigned to either the Red Team or the Blue Team. Players cannot attack players on the same team as they are on. Placement in the event is determined by how many kills and assists a player obtains during the event.<br>
<span>During Team Deathmatch, the following gameplay changes take effect:</span><br>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="body">
    <li>The Devil Chicks, Explosive, and TNT mystics are disabled.</li>
  <li>Gain double <a href = "Gold">gold</a> and <a href = "XP">XP</a> from kills and assists.
</ul>
  <span>The following rewards can be also obtained during Team Deathmatch:</span><br>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="body">
    <li>1 <a href="Renown">renown</a> if the player scored within the top 20, or 2 renown if the player scored within the top 3</li>   
  <li>1,500 <a href="Gold">gold</a> if the player was on the team with the most kills, or 150g if the player was not</li>
</ul>
