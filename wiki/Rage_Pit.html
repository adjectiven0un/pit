<hr>
<span><strong>Rage Pit</strong> is a major event in the Hypixel Pit. Like all major events, when it occurs, 3 minutes advance warning is given. Rage Pit lasts for 4 minutes.</span><br>
<span>When a Rage Pit starts, glass walls appear restricting access to all areas except the center. Players' placement during the event is determined by how much damage they dealt to other players during the event.<br>
<span>During Rage Pit, the following gameplay changes take effect:</span><br>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="body">
    <li>All players have double health.</li>
    <li>Double gold on kills and assists.</li>
    <li>Healing items are replaced with Rage Potatoes (1♥ heal, 2♥ absorption, Resistance II (0:08), Speed I (0:08)). Healing item limits remain the same.</li>
    <li>The Vampire and Soup perks are disabled.</li>
    <li>The Devil Chicks, Explosive and TNT mystics are disabled.</li>
       
</ul>
  <span>The following rewards can be also obtained during Rage Pit:</span><br>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="body">
    <li>1 <a href="Renown">renown</a> if the player scored within the top 20, or 2 renown if the player scored within the top 3</li>   
  <li>500 <a href="Gold">gold</a> if the player scored within the top 20, or 2000 gold if the player scored within the top 3</li>
  <li>100g if the player did not score within the top 20</li>
  <li>500g if 600 total players were killed during the event</li>
  
</ul>
<span class="section">Trivia</span><br>
<span>Prior to a patch in early 2021, the Devil Chicks mystic could be used to deal an absurd amount of damage during the Rage Pit event.</span><br>
  <span>The <a href = "Rage_Pants">Deal with the Devil III</a> enchant, prior to its removal, would increase damage dealt in Rage Pit by 10% while worn.</span><br>
