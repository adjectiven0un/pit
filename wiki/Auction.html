<hr>
<span><strong>Auction</strong> is a <a href="Minor_Event">minor event</a> in the Hypixel Pit. When the event starts, one randomly-generated item will be put up for auction for 1 minute. All players that were in the lobby when the auction started can bid on the item using <a href="Gold">gold</a>. Spending gold on the auction bypasses the gold trade limit. Whoever bids the highest receives the item. Bidding on the item when less than 10 seconds are left extends the auction timer by 10 seconds. If the player loses the auction and is in the lobby when it ends, their gold will be refunded.<br><span>Players are unable to auction items themselves; the only way for players to sell items is through trading.</span><br><br>

<span>There are many types of items that may appear in an Auction event:</span>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="body">
    <li>Tier III Mystic Swords with random enchantments as if enchanted in the Mystic Well</li>
    <li>Tier III Mystic Pants with random enchantments as if enchanted in the Mystic Well</li>
    <li>Tier I Mystic Pants enchanted with Pit MBA I, Fractional Reserve I, or Paparazzi I</li>
    <li><a href="Philosophers_Cactus">Philosopher's Cactus</a></li>
    <li><a href="Chunk_of_Vile">Chunks of Vile</a></li>
    <li>2 <a href="Fresh_Pants">Fresh Pants</a> of any standard color</li>
    <li>2 - 8 Renown</li>

<span>Before <a href="Prestige">prestiging</a>, higher-prestige players occasionally bid absurdly large amounts of gold on auctions as they have nowhere else to spend their gold.</span><br>
<span>The Mystic Pants enchants Pit MBA, Fractional Reserve, and Paparazzi can only be obtained from auctions.</span><br>

<span>Admins, extremely rarely, auction off vanilla Minecraft items for sale. Named "admin items" by the community, these typically are blocks or flowers and are very valuable.</span><br>
<span>The Auction event was added in <a href="https://hypixel.net/threads/the-pit-update-0-4-events-extravaganza.2018236/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Pit 0.4 - Events Extravaganza</a>. Two players were credited for its creation; one suggested the name "Shop Frenzy" for the event.</span></div>
