<span><strong>Raffle</strong> is a major event in the Hypixel Pit. Like all major events, when it occurs, 3 minutes advance warning is given. Raffle lasts for 5 minutes.</span><br>
<span>When a raffle starts, a large box appears in the center of the pit. Raffle Tickets (name tags) also begin generating around the map. Tickets can be picked up and deposited into the box into the center.<br>
<span>During a Raffle, the following gameplay changes take effect:</span><br>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="body">
    <li>Golden ingots (excluding those generated from <a href = "Killstreak#Highlander">Gold Nanofactory</a>) are replaced with Raffle Tickets, which appear in your inventory when picked up.</li>
    <li>When 10 or more tickets are held by a player, the number of tickets they are holding appears in bold yellow text next to their name.</li>
    <li>Killing a player before they can deposit their tickets causes all their tickets to drop to the ground.</li>
    <li>A prize pool of 500 gold for every player in the lobby at the start of the event plus 20 gold for every ticket deposited is stored.</li>
    <li>4 minutes and 30 seconds into the event, three random tickets are selected from the box in a 30-second long process. Players who do not have a <a href = "Prestige">prestige</a> have twice as high of a chance to be selected. In order, the three players selected receive 20%, 30%, and 50% of the prize pool.</li>   
</ul>
  <span>The following rewards can be also obtained during a Raffle:</span><br>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="body">
  <li>1500 gold if the player deposited 27 or more tickets</li>
    <li>1 renown if the player deposited 27 or more tickets</li>   
</ul>
<span class="section">Trivia</span><br>
<span>Prior to the 1.0.5 update, Gold Nanofactory could be used prior to a raffle and the golden ingots would turn into tickets. This could be used to deposit absurdly high amounts of tickets in a single event.</span><br>
<span>Raffle is the event with the least obtainable renown, as a maximum of only 1 can be obtained during the event.</span><br>
<span>On the release of the Genesis map, the raffle box would generate in the spawn area. This was quickly patched.</span>
