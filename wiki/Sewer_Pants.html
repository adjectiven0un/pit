<hr>
<span><strong>Sewer Pants</strong> are special types of <a href = "fresh_Pants">Fresh Pants</a>. They can be found rarely in chests in the City Sewers, or obtained from trading 64 Sewer Rubbish with the Sewerfish in the City Sewers.<br>
<span>Sewer pants function differently from fresh pants. Upgrading sewer pants to tier I requires 250 <a href = "Gold">gold</a>, at which point it will receive 10 or 20 (30 or 40 if the enchant was <span class = "md">RARE!</span> Trash Panda) lives and a random Sewer enchant.</span><br>
 
<span>The list of Sewer enchants is as follows:</span><br>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;" class="body">
    <li>Worm: While in the City Sewers, gain permanent Speed I and +10% rewards from kills.</li>
    <li>Aegis: Gain a magic shield around yourself every 9 seconds. Shields mitigate the effects (damage, knockback) of one attack. Applies after <a href = "Perks#Bonk">Bonk.</li>
    <li>Hidden Jewel: If 117 players are killed while wearing these pants without dying, these pants turn into Tier I Mystic Pants of a standard color with 2-4 lives and a random Tier III enchant.</li>
    <li><span class = "md">RARE!</span> Trash Panda: While wearing, respawn in the City Sewers on death. Hold and right-click to access spawn menus from anywhere. When sewer pants gain this enchant on upgrade, their lives are set to 30 or 40.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<span class="section">Trivia</span><br>
<span>Pants created with Hidden Jewel have significantly more potential than typical mystic pants, as they start with more mystic tokens than usual and can have enchantments not normally obtainable at tier I.</span><br>
